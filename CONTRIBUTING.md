# 🤝 Contributing Guide

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **Useful Public APIs**! 🎉  
This project is a curated list of free and useful APIs: your help makes it better for everyone.

## 📌 What You Can Do

- 🆕 **Add a new API** that doesn't require authentication and is publicly accessible.
- 🔗 **Fix a broken link** or outdated description.
- 🧹 **Remove APIs** that are no longer accessible, free or public.
- ✏️ **Improve the formatting** or readability of the list.
- 🐛 **Report [issues](../../issues) or [pull requests](../../pulls)** (e.g. broken links, inappropriate content, etc).

## ✅ How to Add an API

1. Make sure the API is:
   - Publicly accessible
   - Free to use
   - No API key or OAuth required
2. Add it to the correct category (or create a new category) in the README using this format:

      ```- [**Name**](url) - short description.```
      
      It will turn out like this:
      
      - [**Dog CEO API**](https://dog.ceo/dog-api) - Random pictures of dogs.

3. Open a pull request or an issue with your change. Keep it minimal and focused.

## 🛠️ Technical Guidelines

- Only one API per line.
- Avoid duplicate or redundant entries.
- Do not create new categories unless necessary.
- Keep descriptions short, neutral, and to the point.
